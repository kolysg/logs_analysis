-- 	#3 questions to answer
-- 		1. what are the most popular three articles -sorted list?
-- 			- how do i measure popularity? - count ip address after joining articles with logs table (group by title/slug may be)
-- 			- create a view that join articles with author name
-- 			- create a view that join article id with log id
-- 				- count paths
-- 				- paths have slug as path - /article/slug - so path has to have a regex - use like "%slug%"
-- 		2. who are the most pop authors - sorted list
-- 		3. on which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?
-- 			- example: July 29, 2016 â€” 2.5% errors

--question 1 - most popular three articles of all time

select articles_info.article_name, articles_info.click_count
	from articles_info
	limit 3;

--question 2 - most popular authors
-- select articles_info.author_name, articles_info.click_count
-- 	from articles_info
-- 	limit 3;

-- select author_info.author_name, count(*) as click_count
-- 	from author_info inner join log
-- 	on log.path like concat('%', author_info.article_name, '%')
-- 	where log.status like '%200%'
-- 	group by author_info.author_name
-- 	order by click_count desc
-- 	limit 2;

--question 3 - on which days did more than 1% of requests lead to error
	--a table with time, and error status
	-- convert timestamp 
	-- count % of all errors based on time - divide by total error

-- two views where one has the number of failed calls per day 
-- and then the other with the number of total calls per day.
