-- create a reporting tool
-- 	#prints out reports (in plain text)
-- 	#3 questions to answer
-- 		1. what are the most popular three articles -sorted list?
-- 			- how do i measure popularity? 
-- 			- create a view that JOIN article with author name
-- 			- create a view that JOIN article id with log id
-- 				- count paths
-- 		2. who are the most pop authors - sorted list
-- 		3. ON which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?
-- 			- example: July 29, 2016 â€” 2.5% errors
