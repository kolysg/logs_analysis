-- 			- how do i measure popularity? 
-- 			- create a view that join article with author name
-- 			- create a view that join article id with log id
-- 				- count paths
-- 		2. who are the most pop authors - sorted list
-- 		3. on which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?
-- 			- example: July 29, 2016 â€” 2.5% errors
